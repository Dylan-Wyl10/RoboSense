# FM-MCVRP-style SL spike for RouteCartTSC (YIL-113, requested 2026-07-16)

**Scope: feasibility spike** (user: 粗略地, 2×2/3×3 小网络, 看能不能部署到现有 setting).
Method source: FM-MCVRP (arXiv:2403.00026) — fixed-graph + SL-on-solver-labels recipe;
decoder adapted to our selective/max-utility TOP shape (budget masks + subset selection).

## Verified facts (this session)
- Solve loop: `src/simulation.py` triggers `RouteOptimGurobi` every `optim_interval` s (user: 100 s)
  → build_model → solve_model → getRouteFromX. Networks: `sumo_cfg/toy_net` (3×3 per slide 8) + `5x5net`.
- **Historical per-solve (instance, solution) pairs are NOT persisted** — only coverage tables
  (`result/*/PR* Testing*/pr*_cover_*.npy`) + a few x/y/omg tmp .npy. → training data must be
  (re)generated offline by wrapping RouteOptimGurobi ourselves (which is also the FM-MCVRP way).
- **HGS: NOT found** in repo / ~/ / torchnn env (user said "HGS 的代码也在" — flagged in plan comment;
  waiting for pointer). Gurobi labels are the default; PyVRP(prize-collecting) optional 2nd label machine.
- Env `torchnn`: torch 2.5.1 + CUDA True + gurobipy 11.0.3. (Earlier "no torch" was my activation error:
  must `source ~/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh` first.)
- `result/milpLog/` empty. Working tree has PRE-EXISTING uncommitted src/ mods — do not touch.

## Plan (posted to YIL-113 as plan comment, awaiting green light on open Qs)
- P0 read build_model/solve_model semantics (ask PartB agent only if genuinely ambiguous).
- P1 offline generator: wrap RouteOptimGurobi on toy_net, randomize (veh ODs, start times, demand seed),
  time-limited Gurobi solve → save (instance.json, routes) pairs into experiments/<id>/data/. Target ~5–20k.
- P2 tokenizer (segment/cell IDs over fixed toy graph = small vocab) + small enc-dec Transformer
  (~2-4 layers, d=128, few M params) + CE teacher forcing; feasibility mask (budget/adjacency) at decode.
- P3 eval: held-out utility-gap vs Gurobi labels + vs Gurobi matched-time; 3 seeds; inference latency.

## Open questions (in plan comment)
1. Where is the HGS code the user mentioned?
2. OK to default to Gurobi-as-label-machine for the spike?

## Status
- [x] Repo recon + env verification (above).
- [x] Branch `exp/fm-mcvrp-local` + this dir.
- [x] Plan comment posted to YIL-113.
- [ ] P0 semantics pass on routeOptimGurobi.build_model (next session start here).
- [ ] P1 generator + smoke (3 tiny instances end-to-end) → then scale.

## Next step on resume
Read PROGRESS first (this file). Start P0: read `src/utili/routeOptimGurobi.py` build_model/
build_model_smallexample/solve_model/getRouteFromX closely; extract the instance spec
(inputs: veh_od, max_time, CTM state; outputs: per-veh cell/segment routes + utility).
Then write P1 generator under this dir. Commit early/often on exp/fm-mcvrp-local.
